The purpose of this set of the scripts is to:

- Retrieve a set of the tweets from Twitter, given a query and target language
- Detects the most-likely-intersting tweet based on the Naive-Bayes classifier

One still needs to create training data, which can (and should) be accomplished by manually classifying an already obtained tweets. 

This git repo contains following files: 

- data.yaml: 
- naive_bayes_retweet.py: 
- requirements: 
- search_tweets.py
- train.py
- twitter_conf.yaml:
